<h1>Rewriting embedded libraries with Assembly</h1>
The structure for directories goes as follows:

* inc: does are the libraries used for the reference

* src: code written or compiled by me, follows the below rules

  * .s and .asm files are my own implemenations of functions in assembly

  * .c are reconstructed from inc functions in the original language

Important note for the code inside the inc, it has its own licences I just use it as a reference for lower level deep dive

<h2>TBD</h2>
